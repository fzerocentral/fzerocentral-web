This file contains comments about package.json, since there's no particularly clean way to add comments directly in JSON files.

The focus here is on packages that aren't in a default Ember-CLI app. Default packages can be seen here: https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-new-output/blob/master/package.json



ember-cli-mirage
Mock API server for testing.

ember-cli-tutorial-style
Styling for the official Ember-CLI tutorial.

ember-moment
ember-cli-moment-shim
moment
Date/time library.

ember-power-select
Ember-powered HTML select elements. Base Ember supports input elements, but not select.

ember-sinon-qunit
ember-window-mock
Testing window.confirm() functionality and similar.

ember-truth-helpers
Without this, Handlebars doesn't give a way to use boolean logic in templates. In order words, you'd better hope "if x" is the only thing you ever need. Even "if !x" needs a package like this.

node
ember-cli-update should take care of updating this.
