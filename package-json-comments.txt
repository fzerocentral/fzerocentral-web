This file contains comments about package.json, since there's no particularly clean way to add comments directly in JSON files.



devDependencies

The focus here is on packages that aren't in a default Ember-CLI app. Default packages can be seen here: https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-new-output/blob/master/package.json

ember-cli-mirage
Mock API server for testing.
https://www.ember-cli-mirage.com/docs/getting-started/upgrade-guide

ember-cli-tutorial-style
Styling for the official Ember-CLI tutorial.

ember-moment
ember-cli-moment-shim
moment
Date/time library.
https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-moment/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md
https://github.com/jasonmit/ember-cli-moment-shim/releases
https://github.com/moment/moment/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md

ember-page-title
Set <title> content for each individual route, via a {{page-title}} template helper. Officially recommended, as seen here:
https://guides.emberjs.com/v4.3.0/accessibility/page-template-considerations/
https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-page-title/blob/master/addon/CHANGELOG.md

ember-sinon-qunit
ember-window-mock
Testing window.confirm() functionality and similar.
https://github.com/elwayman02/ember-sinon-qunit/releases
https://github.com/kaliber5/ember-window-mock/releases

ember-truth-helpers
Without this, Handlebars doesn't give a way to use boolean logic in templates other than "if x" and "unless x". This package provides and, or, equals, etc.



engines

ember-cli-update should take care of updating this.



resolutions

whatwg-fetch: See https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-fetch/issues/547
This line can probably be removed once ember is updated to a version that has ember-fetch 8.0.2 or later.
