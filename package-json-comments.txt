This file contains comments about package.json, since there's no particularly clean way to add comments directly in JSON files.

https://github.com/elwayman02/ember-sinon-qunit/releases
https://github.com/kaliber5/ember-window-mock/releases

ember-truth-helpers
Without this, Handlebars doesn't give a way to use boolean logic in templates other than "if x" and "unless x". This package provides and, or, equals, etc.



engines

ember-cli-update should take care of updating this.
